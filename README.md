# ShareX-Re-Engineered
A Reverse Engineered modification of ShareX version 14.1

ShareX has been improved by:
•	Changing the logo of the application so as to easily distinguish the modified version from the original.
•	Removing potentially dangerous default screenshot upload behaviour.
•	Adding a Reddit social link to the Main Form with the aim of being more inclusive to those users wanting to view more user-oriented support forums.
•	Allowing users to specify custom screenshot delay intervals.
•	Adding a convenient all-in-one button to clear the task list and accumulating history logs, which may eventually become storage intensive.
